# Untitled RPG
I may or may not develop this into a full game. The purpose was much more to learn about the ECS, 2D OpenGL, and the basics of game engines rather than to create anything worth playing. 

## Prerequisites
This project and the libraries it utilizes take advantage of modern C++. Your compiler must support at least C++17, though it has only been tested using GCC version 10.3.0, which supports most C++20 features as well. 

Libraries:

+ SDL2
+ GLM
+ [EnTT](https://github.com/skypjack/entt)

Any other dependencies can be seen in the included Makefile.
